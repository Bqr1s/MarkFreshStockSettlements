# SettlementHighlight
UI mod for Rimworld. Highlights settlements that are ether restocked or stock unknon.
Those settlements will be marked by star on the world map.
As for adding this mod to heavy modlists - at your discretion. Mod will only have any efect on visuals and therefore on performance when viewing the world map, but not on colony map.
